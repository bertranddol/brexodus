Dear Regrixter, 

Brexit means brexit.. oh well

This interactive map is to help you make a successfull choice of where to move to next...

With the help of European statitics let's find a new home for you...

We took the main concerns express in the brexit campaigns and exit polls plus few other criteria that
British citizen usually deemed indispensible before considering an exile, then we looked for the closer stats,
colored some maps to show which EU counties do better, same or worse than the UK on those matters...

You can combined those criteria to tailored the map to your needs and desires.

In case of a Brexodus, this is meant to help you...

disclaimer: the stats are accurate, the calculation are correct (to the best of our knowlegde) but the results is JUST FOR FUN, we won't accept any blame if you decide to leave beautiful sunny english countryside ;=)
