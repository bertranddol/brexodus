Dear Regrixter, 

erexit means brexit.. oh well

This interactive map is to help you make a successfull choice of where to move to next...

With the help of European statitics let's find a new home for you...

We took the main concerns expressed in the campaign and brexit polls plus few other criteria that
British citizen deemed indispensable before considering an exile, we selected the closer appropriate stats,
and colored some maps to show which EU counties do better, same or worse than the UK on those matters...
(from green to red... color-blind press the dalto button to switch to another palette)

You can combined those criteria to tailored the map to your needs and desires... seriously!

Get ready for the Brexodus, this app is for you...

disclaimer: the stats are real, the calculation are correct (to the best of our knowlegde) but the results are JUST FOR FUN, we won't accept any blame if you decide to leave the beautiful sunny english countryside and regret it ;=)
